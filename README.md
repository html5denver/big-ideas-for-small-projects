### Code and slides from HTML5 Denver lightning talk. 05/13/13

If you found the talk interesting please let me know. It's been suggested that
I expand the content into a full fledged presentation. New content would include
adding more convenience methods to your components, creating component factories,
e.g., `var myComponent = Component.create();`, and writing tests for your components.
